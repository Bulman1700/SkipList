# SkipList

This is my implementation of a generic probablistic skiplist data structure, written in java. 

Supports: insert(), delete(), contains(), get(), size(), and height() methods.

An empty SkipList has a height of 1 (the head node).

When instatiating a skiplist object, you can either initialize the skiplist with a height of 1 (default), or include an integer 'height' parameter that sets the head node to a specified height.

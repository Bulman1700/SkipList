# SkipList

This is my implementation of a generic probablistic skiplist data structure, written in java. Supports insert(), delete(), and contains() methods.
An empty SkipList has a height of 1 (the head node).

When instatiating a skiplist object, you can either initialize the skiplist with a height of 1 (default), or include a 'height' parameter that sets the head node to a specified height.

default skiplist: new SkipList();
